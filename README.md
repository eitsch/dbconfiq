#Welcome to dbconfiq!
===================


Hey! This is eitsch and you are watching my first try of an github repo coming to life!

Purpose
-------------

dbconfiq is a tool to work with the configuration files of a game called DirtyBomb (fabulously developed by tapirs) and currently it is in its inception (this tool). I do not know which direction this thing will be going, i just was greatly inspired by xyfurion's work to get into this.

Currently you find here a testbed of the following funtionalities:

- build tool: gradle
- code: java
- windows-binaries: launch4j

> **Usage:**

> - clone this repo 
> - open a commandline in the directory containing **gradlew**
> - setup eclipse project files via executing "**gradlew eclipse**"
> - in eclipse you now can refresh and work with the project
> - to get windows executable execute: "**gradlew createExe**"
